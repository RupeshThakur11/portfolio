				<p>Hey! I'm Rupesh. I'm a Senior software developer from New Delhi. I have a wide range of <a href="/skills">full-stack skills</a>, but I tend to focus most of my energy on back-end and front-end web applications. I specialize in building user-centric websites and web applications in Node.js, Python and Spring Boot.</p>
				<p>After graduating with a degree in Information Technology, I moved to the Big Apple where I have <a href="/experience">worked in a variety of industries</a>, including financial services, e-commerce, and most recently, streaming video.</p>
				<p>When I'm not building web apps, I love to travel, run, and explore my city. I also play cricket.</p>
				<p>Whether you need a basic information site, an e-commerce site, or something special, I can help you build the website of your dreams! <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> to get started.</p>
